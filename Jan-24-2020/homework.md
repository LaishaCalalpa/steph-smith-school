Write a program that takes a word problem and returns the answer as an integer.

The program should handle large numbers and negative numbers.

Remember, that these are verbal word problems, not treated as you normally would treat a written problem. This means that you calculate as you move forward each step. In other words, you should ignore order of operations. 3 + 2 * 3 = 15, not 9.

Examples:
```
solver('What is 5 plus 13?') => 18
solver('What is 7 minus 5?') => 2
solver('What is 6 multiplied by 4?') => 24
solver('What is 25 divided by 5?') => 5
```
