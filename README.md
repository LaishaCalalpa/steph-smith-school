# Welcome to Steph Smith School!
The learning experience of the S.S.S has its own github repo now! This is where you'll input your homework assignments, as well as look at the best solutions for them. If you would like to join the slack channel to stay up-to-date with any updates or changes, let me know and I'll add you!


## Getting Started
At the beginning of each class, come to this repo and check for the latest class branch. Once you have the date in mind, go to your text editor and type in `git pull origin (name of branch)`. This will pull in all the files from that branch. Make sure that **you are in the branch you pulled in** by doing `git checkout (name of branch)`. Once you are in that branch, you can interact with the files as you please!


## Homework Assignments
You'll be given a homework assignment to do every night for the week. This is because **practice makes perfect**. We'll be basing these assignments from CodeWars, which will have a lot of practices you can do that will improve your ability to problem solve, as well as become familiar with patterns that will show up throughout problems we face!


### How to Submit a Homework Assignment
Each class will be in a different **branch**. To make sure that you're in the right branch, make sure that in your text editor, it says the date of the most recent class and _not_ master. Push up your homework assignments and create a pull request for that branch.


## Weekly Schedule
We will meet **Wednesday** and **Friday**. Make sure you arrive if you were told to attend! Otherwise, for folks who are just curious or joining in, you're welcome to come take a look and participate! The meet-up's will last from **an hour to an hour and thirty minutes**. If you have to leave by the hour mark, you're free to do so - the extra thirty minutes is just a free-for-all, where any clarifying questions or anything that's confusing to you will be answered or looked at.
