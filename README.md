# Welcome to Steph Smith School!
The learning experience of the S.S.S has its own github repo now! This is where you'll input your homework assignments, as well as look at the best solutions for them. If you would like to join the slack channel to stay up-to-date with any updates or changes, let me know and I'll add you!


## Homework Assignments
You'll be given a homework assignment to do for the week. This is because **practice makes perfect**. We'll be basing these assignments from CodeWars, which will have a lot of practices you can do that will improve your ability to problem solve, as well as become familiar with patterns that will show up throughout problems we face!


## Weekly Schedule
We will meet **Wednesday** and **Friday**. Make sure you arrive if you were told to attend! Otherwise, for folks who are just curious or joining in, you're welcome to come take a look and participate! The meet-up's will last from **an hour to an hour and thirty minutes**. If you have to leave by the hour mark, you're free to do so - the extra thirty minutes is just a free-for-all, where any clarifying questions or anything that's confusing to you will be answered or looked at.
